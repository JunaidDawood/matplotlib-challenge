## In this homework, our task was to analyze the animal experiment data that compares the efficiency of 9 oncology drugs. Three conclusions we can draw from the analysis are:


* ### The box plot indicates that Capomulin and Ramicane are far more effective at lowering Tumor Volume than Infubinol and Ceftamin.

* ### The data collected at the final timepoint for the four selected drugs, only had one outlier (in the Infubinol treatment group).

* ### In regards to mouse weight versus tumor volume, the correlational coefficent 0.84 (r-squared of .71), provides evidence to suggest that larger mice are likely to have larger tumors.
